# Question #5

First, we know that the probability of picking a red marble is:

![P(R)=0.55](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%28R%29%3D0.55)

This implies:

![P(not R) = 0.45](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%28%5Cneg%20R%29%3D1-P%28R%29%3D0.45)

So, first we calculate the probability that a single sample has at least


The probability that a single sample has at least one red ball is ![1][1] minus
the probability that a single sample has no red balls:

The probability that all ![1000][1000] samples have at least one red ball is:

![step 2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%281%20-%20%281-%5Cmu%29%5EN%29%5E%7B1000%7D%3D%281-0.45%5E%7B10%7D%29%5E%7B1000%7D%3D0.9996595%5E%7B1000%7D%3D0.711)

The probability we want is that one or more samples have no red balls which
equals ![1][1] minus the probability that all ![1000][1000] samples have at
lease one red ball:
