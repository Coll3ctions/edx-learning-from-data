# Question #5

First, we know that the probability of picking a red marble is:

![P(R)=0.55](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%28R%29%3D%5Cmu%3D0.55)

This implies:

![P(not R) = 0.45](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%28%5Cneg%20R%29%3D1-P%28R%29%3D0.45)

The probability of a sample with no red marbles is given by:

![P(A) = 0.45^10](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%28A%29%3DP%28%5Cneg%20R%29%5EN%3D0.45%5E%7B10%7D)

So the probability that a single sample has at least one red marble is the
complement of the probability that a single sample has no red marbles:

![P(not A) = 0.9996595](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%28%5Cneg%20A%29%3D1-P%28A%29%3D1-0.45%5E%7B10%7D)

Finally, the probability of at least one of the samples have no red marbles is
the complement of the probability that at least one of the ![1000][1000]
samples has at least one red marble:

![P = 0.289](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1-P%28%5Cneg%20A%29%5E%7B1000%7D%20%3D%201%20-%20%281%20-%200.45%5E%7B10%7D%29%5E%7B1000%7D%5Capprox0.289)
