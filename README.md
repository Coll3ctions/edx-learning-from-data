# Learning From Data - Homework Solutions

This is the code/math I wrote in order to solve most of the assignments of
[Learning From Data](https://www.edx.org/course/caltechx/cs1156x/learning-data/1120),
a machine learning course by Caltech.

**Disclaimer:** Don't follow this material blindly, it might be wrong. Use
your judgement.

### A Note About The Honor Code

The solutions are being released incrementally, one assignment at a time,
after each deadline. According to the course staff, this is ok; in fact, the
professor himself encourages the students to show their solutions.

To fully enjoy the course, do not look at the solutions provided here until you
submit your answer.

## Requirements

* [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) 3.6+

## How The Assignments Are Organized

Solutions for each week's homework are kept in its own directory. Each directory
contains a README file that explains what it provides.
