# Learning From Data - Homework code

This is the code I wrote in order to solve most of the assignments of
[Learning From Data](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html), a machine
learning course by Caltech.

**Disclaimer:** Don't follow this code blindly, it might be wrong. Use
your judgement.

### A Note About The Honor Code

This code is being released incrementally, one assignment at a time, after each
deadline. According to the course staff, this is ok; in fact, the professor
himself encourages the students to show their solutions.

To fully enjoy the course, do not look at the code provided here until you
submit your answer.

## Requirements

* [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) 3.6+

## How The Assignments Are Organized

Code for each week are kept in their own directory with a README file that
explains what is provided along with plots if there are any.
